## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Technical Approach
implementing advanced technologies to boost farm productivity, optimize supply chains, and create new rural economic opportunities. Key strategies include using precision agriculture techniques like drone monitoring and sensor-based data analysis to manage irrigation and crop health, adopting digital platforms for market access and credit, implementing sustainable farming methods such as organic practices, and leveraging robotics for tasks like weeding and harvesting. It also requires developing rural infrastructure for logistics and creating village-level entrepreneurships through training in new technologies to foster local empowerment and livelihoods.

## Feasibility and Viability
promising food tech idea for rural development is a mobile-first agricultural advisory and service platform that uses IoT and data to provide real-time guidance on soil health, irrigation, and pest management, combined with market access services to connect rural farmers to buyers of their produce. This concept integrates smart farming technologies to increase productivity and directly addresses the challenges of information asymmetry and limited market access in rural areas, which are often faced by farmers.

## Impact and Benefits
boosting farmer incomes, increasing crop yields, creating new jobs, and improving food security through efficiency and market access. These technologies, such as precision agriculture and digital platforms, help to reduce input costs, conserve natural resources, and make rural economies more resilient and competitive. Digitalization also connects rural areas to new markets and financial services, supporting smallholder farmers and reducing rural-to-urban migration.
